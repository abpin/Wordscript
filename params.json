Everyone uses it, is comfortable. Its not going away. I spent some time playing around with the JSON API Plugin, and found it easier to work with JSON structures for many applications. I was not thrilled with still needing to use a wordpress plugin so I began porting the SQL from an old project, ikipress, into simple API's influenced by get parameters in PHP, Ruby and Node.js. Also included is a Node.js javascript that wraps your Wordpress site into html (basically the api with a html wrapper).\r\n\r\nThe API is designed to be as bare bones as possible, leaving the developer to implement more advanced templating engines or frameworks.\r\n\r\n## Included\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Javascript wordpress reader [WP JSON API Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/) in js/\r\n\r\n## API's\r\n### in /api\r\n### PHP API\r\n### Ruby API\r\n### Node.js API \r\n\r\n","tagline":"Wordpress in JSON via API (json api plugin/php/ruby)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
