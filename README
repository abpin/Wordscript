## Wordscript

## Wordpress via JSON

## Whats the big idea?
   
  Wordpress is ubiquitious. Everyone uses it, is comfortable. Its not going away. I spent some time playing around with
the JSON API Plugin, and found it easier to work with JSON structures for many applications. I took it a step further
and wrote a PHP API to connect directly to a wordpress database ( in /scripts/); negating the need for Wordpress
to be installed; even MySQL in many cases.
