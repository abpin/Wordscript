	Wordscript JSON API (PHP) 
	Ronaldo Barbachano
	This provides a simple interfaces for retreving
	Wordpress MySQL data; without needing an installed/ working
	version of Wordpress. If a database allows remote connections, the
	MySQL server could also be remote.

	**WHY**
	
	Much faster. Uses a fraction of memory. Design your applications
	around json structures. Easy to implement in javascript applications.
	Eventually I will write a ruby version, so the intention is to
	be able to display wordpress on systems without PHP,MySQL.
	
	**HOW**
	
	This API generates queries based on passed get parameters to deliver
	json structures.
	
	This can effectively seperate 'development' enviornments from
	production, and can still allow usage of the administrative interface.
	
	**What this won't do**
	
	You're going to have to kiss your plugin's goodbye. Its a great time
	to learn javascript! You can't use this API to modify anything in the
	database, and this does not track comments or multi-level category hiearchy.
	
	**General API Setup**
	
	'base url'
	wp_api.php?json=-directive-/-option-/-option-value/limit/desc-asc
	
	also
	
	wp_api.php?json=-directive-/limit/desc-asc
	
	Examples:
	
	(get 10 latests posts)
	
	wp_api.php?json=posts/10
	
	(get 10 latest posts inside  'news' categories)
	
	wp_api.php?json=posts/category/news/10
	
	(get categories)
	
	wp_api.php?json=categories
	
	**Cool _GET options**
	
	Add these after the &json= to enable some simple options like...
	
	&stats
	 	--will add basic statistics (load,query count, and memory use)
	
	&embed 
		--will add 'var wp_api=[json];' which should make it easier to include as a javascript
	&noTag
		-- Does not look up tags (saves a crap load of queries)
	&categories
		-- includes categories (?json=categories)
