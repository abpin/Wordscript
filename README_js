	## WP JSON API Plugin (Javascript Client example)
	
	## Builds a wordpress site in pure javascript, with ability to view posts by categories (all on a single page).

        Takes the hassle out of handling XHR requests and parsing wordpress data.

        Makes two XHR calls, does not use jquery.

        Basic Usage:

        Simply put the page somewhere on your wordpress site and provide a url to the wordpress blog (to build the
        api queries for the plugin).

        Make links like:
        <a href="#" onclick="wp_build_post('?json=- your query with params-')">Link</a>

        To issue an additional XHR request and rebuild the 'content' div.

        ## Example of this is inside of function wp_build_categories()

        Useful functions:

        wp_build_posts() - this builds posts. Pass it a url like ?json=<function>&param1=value1, it'll make a xhr call
        and update the content div (only) change the body onload param to modify what gets show initially


        _tag() - just a little connivence function that assembles html, haven't decided how much I like it versus
        writing html like 'normal'

        ToDo:

        Implement pages/links/tags. Should not be hard with function wp_build_posts(). Reuse XHR requests to
        only use one at a time.

        Speed it up?

        Obviously enter any static data as html (categories/links/pages) - as those fields do not change often,
        cache a json response to a file to load instead of hitting the API all of the time - which seems to be
        as intensive (maybe less) than a real wordpress site.
